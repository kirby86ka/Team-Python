# InsightShield - Behavioral Risk Detection System

## Purpose

InsightShield identifies at-risk students through behavioral pattern analysis. The system detects early signs of disengagement by analyzing submission patterns, activity streaks, and assignment performance to categorize students into risk levels (Low, Medium, High) and provide mentors with actionable intervention points.

## Key Metrics

- **Build Time**: 1.88s (production-optimized)
- **Bundle Size**: 487KB (153KB gzipped)
- **Startup Time**: 0.9s (lazy database initialization)
- **Code Reduction**: 54% reduction through modular architecture
- **Risk Categories**: 3 levels (Low, Medium, High)
- **Algorithm**: Rule-based scoring engine (deterministic, explainable)

## Core Features

### Risk Detection Engine
Analyzes multiple behavioral factors:
- Submission timing patterns
- Assignment completion rates
- Activity streak tracking
- Performance trends
- Engagement frequency

Weights each factor to compute an aggregate risk score for transparent, explainable alerts.

### Alert System
Automated notification system that flags concerning patterns and provides mentors with real-time alerts for intervention.

### Student Analytics
Detailed per-student profiles with risk trends, question-level breakdowns, and activity history.

**Note**: The current assignment creation/submission system is a temporary demo, so everything might not work. Production deployment will integrate with existing platforms (Google Classroom, Canvas, etc.) to pull assignment data and provide analytics as an extension layer.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Chart.js, custom CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js
- **Database**: SQLite3 with WAL mode, pragma optimizations
- **Auth**: JWT with role-based access control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

From here, either:
### Quick Launch 
1. **Clone the Identity**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jam232006/Team-Python.git
   cd Team-Python
   ```

2. **One-Click Launch**:
   
   **Windows:**
   ```bash
   quick-launch.bat
   ```
   
   **Mac/Linux:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x quick-launch.sh
   ./quick-launch.sh
   ```

   The script will automatically:
   - Install dependencies (if needed)
   - Start backend server on http://localhost:5000
   - Start frontend server on http://localhost:5173
   - Open your browser
   - Show test credentials

or:
### Manual Installation
1. **Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install

- Student (High Risk): daksh@insight.com / password123
- Student (Low Risk): arjun@insight.com / password123

## Architecture Notes

- Metadata-only analysis (timestamps, submission status, scores)
- Deterministic rule-based engine for transparent decisions
- Role-based data access (mentors see only their assigned classes)
- SQLite optimizations: WAL mode, 10MB cache, memory temp storage, indexed queries
- Memoized React components for dashboard performance

## Future Development

- Integration with existing LMS platforms (Google Classroom, Canvas)
- Deployment to production server environment
- Redis caching layer
- Enhanced frontend visualizations

Team-Python 2026
  -Redis caching and optimization all across the board
  -Make the frontend more complex
---------
v1 Edits:
Added #pragma and write ahead logging for the SQL tables.
pragma-sync, increased cache size (10 MB is enough, maybe?), temp storage w/ RAM, 30 GB MMAP
added more indexes for direct queries
lazy dbs for every server restart, reducing to 0.9 s startup (will be changed later.)
memoized react components for dashboards since they use similar stuff
